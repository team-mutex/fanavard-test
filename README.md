# Test
The very first question for the 6th [Fanavard](https://fanavard.com/) contest.
We read inputs from stdin (standard input) and write our answer to the stdout
(standard output). 

## Requirements
Code has been written with Python 3. We didn't use any library or database,
so you can run code as it is. All you need is a Python 3 interpreter.

## Samples
To run the codes with sample data you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py < samples/1.txt
```
